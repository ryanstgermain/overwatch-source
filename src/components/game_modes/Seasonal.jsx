          <p className='about-seasonal-game-mode'>
            This game mode is tied with the Winter Wonderland event that is a 6v6 style mode 
            where Mei is the hero of choice and her primary weapon uses only one ammo. The 
            only way to obtain more ammo is through piles of snow on the map or her ultimate, 
            which gives her unlimited ammo for a small amount of time. Mei's ammo kills the 
            opponent in one shot.

        <div>
          <p className='about-seasonal-game-mode'>
            This game mode is tied with the Winter Wonderland event that is a 5v1 style mode 
            where 5 players who are Mei must hunt down the yeti which is Winston. The yeti 
            must obtain pieces of meat throughout the map is activate his ultimate ability. 
            If the yeti kills all of the Mei team, the yeti wins. If the team of Mei kill the 
            yeti, that team wins.
